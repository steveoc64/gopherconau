## Notes
- The following sections represent slide content, with a 1-2 minute maximum window to cover.  

- The more detailed sections with code examples and looking at internals will be 4-5 minutes max.

- Depending on the audience, I can compress the lead up content and spend more time on the hard details
 if needed.
- Aiming to pull the presentation in around 25mins, with a 5min window at the end to take Q&As
